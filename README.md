# Fuzz introspector

Fuzz introspector is a tool to help fuzzer developers to get an understanding of their fuzzer’s performance 
and identify any potential blockers. Fuzz introspector aggregates the fuzzers’ functional data like coverage,
hit frequency, entry points, etc to give the developer a birds eye view of their fuzzer. This helps with 
identifying fuzz bottlenecks and blockers and eventually helps in developing better fuzzers.

Fuzz-introspector aims to improve fuzzing experience of a project by guiding on whether you should:
- introduce new fuzzers to a fuzz harness
- modify existing fuzzers to improve the quality of your harness.
