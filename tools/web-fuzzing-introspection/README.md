# Fuzz Introspetor macro website UI


This app is used to display fuzz introspector data for many projects in a single
unified manner. The main usage of this is https://introspector.oss-fuzz.com/

In order to launch this website first step is to create a DB and then it's
ready to launch. The DB creator script scans Fuzz Introspector reports as
generated by OSS-Fuzz. The webapp will then display this data and make it
available through various APIs.

## Launching a local version

The following commands can be used to launch a version of the webapp using
a subet of the projects on OSS-Fuzz.

```bash
# Get source
git clone https://github.com/ossf/fuzz-introspector
cd tools/web-fuzzing-introspection

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m virtualenv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt


# Create (small) DB
cd app/static/assets/db/
launch_minor_oss_fuzz.sh
cd ../../../

# Start the web app
python3 ./main.py
# ...
# Should show output along the lines of:
# Not setting google tag
# Loading db
# ...
