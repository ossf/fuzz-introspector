Welcome to Fuzz Introspector's documentation!
=============================================

Fuzz introspector is a tool to help fuzzer developers to get an understanding
of their fuzzer’s performance and identify any potential blockers. Fuzz
Introspector aggregates the fuzzers’ functional data like coverage, hit
frequency, entry points, etc to give the developer a birds eye view of their
fuzzer. This helps with identifying fuzz bottlenecks and blockers and
eventually helps in developing better fuzzers.
