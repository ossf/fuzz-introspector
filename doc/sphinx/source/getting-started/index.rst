Getting started
===============

This guide will walk you through the default installation of Fuzz Introspector.
After this guide you will have run Fuzz Introspector on a simple example and
will have been exposed to the mechanics of running Fuzz Introspector.


.. note::
   The fastest way to try Fuzz Introspector locally is to use it by way of
   OSS-Fuzz, because OSS-Fuzz provides a lot of mechanics for running Fuzz
   Intropector. See :ref:`Running introspector on an OSS-Fuzz project` on how
   to run Fuzz Introspector by way of OSS-Fuzz.
